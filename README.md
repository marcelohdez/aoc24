# Advent of Code 2024

...in TypeScript using Node (trying something new).

To begin, install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Finally, run the day, e.g.:

```bash
node build/day1.ts
```

## Input

This repository contains my AoC input in the `input` folder, if you would like
to try with your own, just replace the `dayN.txt` file accordingly!
